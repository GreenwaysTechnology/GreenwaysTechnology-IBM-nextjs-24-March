What is a Next?
	 Next is a flexible React framework that gives you building blocks to create fast "web applications".

What is React?
         React is javascript lib to build "Single Page Web applications"


What is web app?
  Type of distributed app,deployed at server , accessed over network(internet) vi various network protocals like http,tcp,smtp...
  
  Web apps works based on request and response model.
  Web apps are hosted on server called web server.

Web server receives request , runs a program, that program returns response to the client.

Response would be document.
=>HTML

other responses types
XML,JSON,Documents,images,vidoes.........

What is web and why it was created?

  Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist, invented the World Wide Web (WWW) in 1989, while working at CERN. The web was originally conceived and developed to meet the demand for automated information-sharing between scientists in universities and institutes around the world.

The first Web browser is line mode web browser,launched in 1992.


The first web server is NeXT computer

The first web page , lanuched http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html.


Types of Web application:

1.Static web applications - 1989 to 1995
    Hard coded html pages, Prepared html pages kept at server, the web server will send those html pages to clients - browsers
   Do you think Static web applications still exits?

 Yes!, but we dont prepare the html pages by hand.. rather we ask the server to prepare..



2.Dynamic Content generation application(1996 to till date)

  After 1995, many people thought that how we can use web for biz information system

 how to share biz informations via internet.
 Generally biz data is stored in databases , how to embed data base data into html pages

 1.web server need to talk to database
 2.web server need to prepare html pages based on database records
 3.Those information must be transported to web clients.

Web server core design to get client request and send html response to the client.

Along with web server, something was introduced called "Programming language runtime"


3.Web services-1998 to till date

 Rise of ECommerce, using internet and web how to exchange data between two biz organizations.
 The existing html technology was not suitable to send and recive data because html is just user interface document language.

 We need , data to be exechanged, thats where new data model was created called 'XML'
xml based web apps called web services.

soap protocal was created to transfer XML based documents "SOAP based webservices"

After 2005 soap based web services, started failing due to mobile computing.

New Web services  were designed called "RestFull Web services"

Restfull web services were used to build any type of data formats like json,xml,pdf,html etc...

The first run time was created based on "c" language called "CGI-comman Gate way interface" later instead of c language "PERL" language.


4.Client side web apps called "Single Page Web Apps"(2007 to till date)

Single page web apps are built using javascript at client side where as server side web services(REST apis) are used.

SPA Tech stack:
HTML 5,CSS 3, Javascript.
Frameworks build based on SPA

1.Angular js
2.react
3.vue js
............................................................................................
				React as SPA lib
............................................................................................

Reactjs was created by facebook , in order to build SPA applications for browsers.


Advantages of SPA:
1.Pages are created  at client side, so server load is completly removed
2.SPA reduces the lot of phsyical pages after deployment.
3.Clear separations of concerns.

Drawbacks of SPA:
.................

Pure client SPAs are problematic when the app is senstive to SEO and time-to concept
This is because the browser will recive a large empty HTML page and has to wait until the javascript is loaded before rendering any thing.

	    The brith of new Technology called  "SSR" -  Server Side Rendering
    ..................................................................................

I need SEO but at the same time, i want to use SPA as well.
We provides first class api to "render"  an SPA app into HTML strings on the server.

This allows server to send back already rendered HTML, allowing end users to see the content immediately while the javascript is being downloaded.

This process is called "hydration", the app is compiled at server side and sent to the client which will be  interactive.
............................................................................................
				Rendering Types
............................................................................................

What is Rendering?
   Render means preparation,HTML Page prepartion...

Rendering Types:
1.CSR- Client side Rendering.
   HTML Pages are prepared at client side - SPA Applications
2.SSR  -Server Side rendering
   HTML Pages are prepared at server side - Dynamic Content Generation applications.

Based on these rendering type, we can classify other rendering

1.Universal rendering /Hybrid Rendering
  Server + Client side , coimbing both rendering 

2.Full SSR and Partial SSR
    Partial SSR is nothing but only "index.html" is compiled at server , rest of the application is rendered at client side.
   Full SSR is nothing but "index.html" and other pages are compiled at server....
.............................................................................................
			When Rendering can happen
		     (when html pages are parepared)
.............................................................................................

1.Request time
2.Build time

1.Request time :
 When user types url 

  http://www.example.com/product--------------->Server Receives Request----Prepares Page--send   that page to client.

2.Build time
    Build is nothing but, preparing app for production.. before hosting we have to prepare the     app
  During build phase, we can prepare html pages/render html pages 

			SSG -  Static Site Generations

Building web sites/apps during build phase is called SSG.

Why SSG?
  Super fast page access

Based On SSG , There is specfication is available "JAM Stack"
...........................................................................................
			Drawback of SSG(JAMStack App)
..........................................................................................
If page has data, which is keep on changing, preparing a page "ahead of time", that causes problem. that means we cant generate page on demand...

Data changes rapidly , we need to enable request time page prepartion.
.........................................................................................................................................
			ISR - Incremental Static Rendenering
...........................................................................................

SSG - Build time or ahead of time
SSR - Request time

ISR = SSG + SSR - Build time + request time 
.............................................................................................

What is Nextjs?

  Next js is a framework that helps to build web apps of all types

 you can build Full SSR apps..
 you can build SSR With Request time
 you can build SSG with Build time -  JAMStacks
 you can build SSR with CSR  - Server + SPA - Hybrid rendering
 you can build rest apis also - Web services

Using Next you can build 
 Pure server side apps with database access, other external api access.....
..............................................................................................
		               Next js UI layer
.............................................................................................

Next js uses "react core features" to build UI layer...

React core features:
1.React compoent driven
2.React uses data mutation techniques like props and state
3.React uses event listeners for interactions
4.React hooks

Nextjs tech stack:

1.React as ui layer
2.Next does not recommend to use "redux"
3.Next uses api layer- rest api development
4.Next can talk to any database via orm frameworks...
..............................................................................................
			Next js Architecture:
.............................................................................................

Next js uses "Rust based build system" where as react uses web pack build ....

What is Rust?
 It is programming langugage, used to build Nextjs apps. Next core engine is written in Rust only.

Next.js Compiler:
..................
 Next js Compiler is written using RUST Using SWC (Speedy Web Compiler).

SWC allows next js to transform and minify the js code for production. This replaces babel.

SWC is 17x faster than Babel, it is embeded inside next js

what is mjs?
    if you want to run "es 6  module" code on node js, which is not allowed by default.

if you want to run es 6 module code(export,import,export default)

Solution:
1.you have to convert es6 module code into commonjs , so that node can understand
2.you have to configure package.json 
   "type:module"
3.you have to save file with "fileName.mjs" extension.

			  Next App is Conventional Over Configuration
..............................................................................................

                           "In Next every folder and files are predefined"


In Next there is no predefined index.html, because index.html is generated by Next js server during request time or build time.

File Names:
src/app
 1.page.js
 2.layout.js

 These files names are predefiend file names we cant change file names as we wish.

Files have been designed based on conventional over configuratotion, meaning ever file has meaning.

page.js
   It is holding user interface, if the page.js is part of "src/app" folder which is root file(index.html) called as landing page.

layout.js
   It is going to hold root layout,Which is required file.


           "Every Nextjs app must have this "src/app/layout.js" file

What is this files are all about?

 "React Components"

Page Component - page.js
Layout Component - layout.js
.............................................................................................
			 React core features inside next js
.............................................................................................
1.Component:
   In react every thing is component, in next also the component driven arch is followed.

2.Props
    In react data is passed to the component via props.

Types of Props:
1.Data as prop
2.State as Prop -Dynamic Prop
3.function as Prop- Listeners as Prop
4.Component as Prop

Component as Props syntax we use heavily.

Syntax : Component Rendering:
...........................

<Tab /> - Self closing 
   There is no child element

<Tab>
   <Grid/> - Component as Prop
</Tab>

const Tab = props=>{

  return <>
	{props.children}
  </>
}

Next:

<Layout>
	?   ---> <Page/> -- Index Page
</Layout>

.....................................................................................
			 Every thing is component is in Next.js
.....................................................................................

Page Component:
  It is place holder component which displays ui.

Layout Component:
  It is container component which holds Page Component

           layout - parent
	  ------------------------------
          |                             |
                      Page -child       |
          |                             |
          |                             |
          |                             |
           -------------------------------

How to declare compoents?

 1.every component must be "functional component" - No Class Component.
 2.every component must be exported using "export default" only.
 3.Every Next application must have "root layout" src/app/layout.js
 4.Every Next application must have  "home/landing page" src/app/page.js

src/app/page.js


export default function HomePage() {

      return <div>
          <h1>Home Page</h1>
      </div>

}

Root Layout:
src/app/
export default function RootLayout(props) {

  return <html lang="en">
    {/* Insert page */}
    <body>{props.children}</body>
  </html>

}

<RootLayout>
   <HomePage/>
</RootLayout>
.....................................................................................
			  File Conventions
......................................................................................
layout.js
  Shared UI for a segment(page/router) and its children
  if a layout.js presents inside src/app folder which is called root layout.
  if every next.js app must have one layout.js which is root layout file.

nestedlayout -layout.js
   Shared UI for a a segement and its children
  when you define routing, that time we may or not use layout...

root layout vs nested layout:
  root layout must have <html>,nested layout <div> or section elements

eg:

 <html>
  <head></head>
  <title>title</title> 
   <body>
	<nested Layout>Insert Page</nestedLayout>
   </body>
 </html>

page.js
  Unique UI of a route,meaning the page is mapped against routing like "/",index,products,users,customers

loading.js
  Loading UI (Spinner) for a segement and its children

not-found.js
   Not Found UI for a segment and for its children
   if routing is failed to map against a page, then next.js will show error page.

error.js
  It is used to show custom component logic errors.
Note:
  All error files are represented by "React Error Boundary".

global-error.js
  It is to show app level errors.

template:
  Specailzied re-rendered layout UI.

route.js
  you can write "restfull" web services".

default.js
  Fallback UI for "Parrel Routes"
 
Note:
 When we write next application, every thing is component
  Error is component
  Loading is Compoent
  Page is component
  Layout is compoent.

Since Everything is compoent , which forms component hierachy.

React dev tool can used to look into the component hiearchy....

Using react dev tool we can look , next application....

Component Structure/Hierarchy:
..............................

<Layout>
   <Template>
	<ErrorBoundary fallback={<Error/>}>
	   <Suspense fallback={<Loading/>}>
		<ErrorBoundary fallback={<NotFound/>}
		    <Page/>	
		<ErrorBoundary>
           <Suspense>	
        </ErrorBoundary>
   </Template>	
</Layout>
....................................................................................
			   Routing
		       Pages and Layouts
....................................................................................

In Next js application routing is core concept, every thing is built on the top of routing only.

In Next js routing is in built.

The Skeleton of every next app is routing only.

Routing is mapped against folders and files only...

Inside the app directory, "folders" are used to define routes...

src/app/ ---- index route or home route.

http://localhost:3000/ ------->src/app/layout.js ---> page.js


Route Segment:

  Each folder represents a "route segment" that maps to a "URL" segement. in order to create route you can nest folders inside each other	

URL Pattern:

localhost:3000 /    
	       |
            Root segment

Segment means part of url.


localhost:3000 /     dashboard /settings
		|       |            |              
	Root segment  Segment   leaf Segment

How to create segments(eiether root/segement/leaf)?
  A special file called page.js to make route segments publicly accessible.

eg:

src/app/welcome/layout.js
// welcome page layout 

export default function WelcomeLayout({ children }) {
    return <div id="welcomelayout" style={{color:'red'}}>
        {children}
    </div>
}

src/app/welcome/page.js


export default function WelcomePage() {
    return <div>
        <h1>Welcome</h1>
    </div>
}

http://localhost/welcome

Nested Route:
src/app/welcome/hello/layout.js
export default function HelloLayout({ children }) {
    return <div id="hellolayout">
        {children}
    </div>
}
src/app/welcome/hello/page.js
export default function HelloPage(){
    return <>
        <h1>Hello Page</h1>
    </>
}

http://localhost:3000/welcome/hello
...................................................................................
			 Page Not found
..................................................................................
what if i have folder src/app/welcome/hai , but no page.js

http://localhost:3000/welcome/hai

You will get page not found, error

if no page.js found, then it will throw "404 Page Not Found" , that means next automatically fallback to "ErrorBoundary" , it maps against default notfound.js message.

What if i want custom NotFound Error page?

src/app/not-found.js

export default function NotFound() {
    return <h1>
        The Page you requested not available
    </h1>
}
....................................................................................
			    Public Access Route

if you have different name other than page.js , it will not be available for public access.

 app/settings/config.js

http://localhost:3000/settings/config - It will throw error.
....................................................................................
			  Pages and Other Components
....................................................................................

Layout is container, Page is mapped against route segement, which displays UI.

Can page hold other Components?

Yes

			    Co-location

In addition to special files, you have the option to colocate your own files (e.g. components, styles, tests, etc) inside folders in the app or any route  directory.


co-located file:
src/app/welcome/Greet.jsx
//here you can use export or export default .

export default function Greet(props) {
     return <>
        <h1>{props.message}</h1>
     </>
}

src/app/welcome/page.js
import Greet from "./Greet";

export default function WelcomePage(){
    return <>
       <Greet message="Hello"/>
    </>
}

src/app/welcome/layout.js
export default function WelcomeLayout({ children }) {
    return <div>
        {children}
    </div>
}
.....................................................................................
			Component Types and Rendering Types
.....................................................................................

Rendering is nothing but page preparation (html creation).

How to create html and where to create Html?

Where:
 rendering can take place in the server or on the client.

When:
  At Server side:
  It can happen either ahead of time at build time.
  or on every Request at runtime.

With next js , three types of rendering methods are available.

1.Server-side rendering
   1.0. Request time
   1.1. Static site Generation - build time
   1.2. ISR - Incremental Static rendering - first Build time and later runtime.

2.Client Rendering
   Preparing portion of page at client side , which is similar to SPA Apps.

Component types:
 Based on Rendering, we can classify the component into two category.

1.Server Component
   Server components are rendered at server side
2.Client components
   Clients components are rendered at client side

  By default all components are "Server Rendered Components"

   page,layouts,templates,notfound,loading,default all are server components only

Even When create custom components

export default function Greet(props) {
     return <>
        <h1>{props.message}</h1>
     </>
}
.....................................................................................
			Client Component
....................................................................................

Generally React application is component driven....
Component which may have logic to interact with user like button clicks,typing,animations,data fetch at client side any dom manipulation......

The components can be co-located..

Client components allow us to write interactive UI that is prendered on the server and can use client javascript to run in the browser.

Advantages of client Rendering:

1.Interactivity
   Client components uses "state,effects,event listener" , meaning they can provide immediate feedback to the user and update the UI.

2.Browser APIs:
   Client components have access the browser apis like Storage,geo location....

How to create Client Component?

src/app/reviews/page.js
import Like from "./like";

export default function ReviewPage(){
    return <>
        <h1>Review Page</h1>
        <Like/>
    </>
}

src/app/reviews/like.jsx
import { useState } from "react"

export default function Like() {
    //declare state
    const [like, setLike] = useState(0)

    return <div>
        <h3>Like {like}</h3>
    </div>
}

After this code, next is throwing compile time error...

./src/app/reviews/like.jsx
Error: 
  × You're importing a component that needs useState. It only works in a Client Component but none of its parents are marked with "use client", so they're Server Components by default.
  │ Learn more: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials
  │ 
  │ 
   ╭─[G:\IBM\2024\March\Nextjs\next-components\src\app\reviews\like.jsx:1:1]
 1 │ import { useState } from "react"
   ·          ────────
 2 │ 
 3 │ export default function Like() {
 3 │     //declare state
   ╰────

Why this error?
  Server not able to render the above code, the reason is the code is subject to browser rendering, means that server does not how to treat this code.
 in order to compile this code, we need to convert this component into client component...
 we need to use directive called "use client"

solution:
 'use client'
import { useState } from "react"

export default function Like() {
    //declare state
    const [like, setLike] = useState(0)

    return <div>
        <h3>Like {like}</h3>
    </div>
}

How to mutate the state?
 Similar to react code...
 
'use client'
import { useState } from "react"

export default function Like() {
    //declare state
    const [like, setLike] = useState(0)

    const onLike = () => {
        setLike(like + 1)
    }

    return <div>
        <h3>Like {like}</h3>
        <button onClick={onLike}>Like</button>
    </div>
}

How to know the client component?

if component has 

1.useState hook
2.Any listener
3.useEffect hook

....................................................................................
		Patterns for client and server components

1.Server component uses client component...

2.Client component uses another server component

3.Client component uses another client component

src/app/reviews/page.js
import Like from "./like";

export default function ReviewPage(){
    return <>
        <h1>Review Page</h1>
        <Like/>
    </>
}
client component
src/app/reviews/like.jsx
'use client'
import { useState } from "react"

export default function Like() {
    //declare state
    const [like, setLike] = useState(0)

    const onLike = () => {
        setLike(like + 1)
    }

    return <div>
        <h3>Like {like}</h3>
        <button onClick={onLike}>Like</button>
    </div>
}

Note:
 if server uses client, the component must be marked with "use client" directive..
...................................................................................

2.Client component uses another server component.

  if client uses another server component, Server Component automatically becomes client component.
 when we use this pattern, we loose server rendering...


}

server:
src/app/reviews/Dislike.jsx
export default function DislikeServer() {
      return <div>
       <h1>Dislike Server</h1>
    </div>
}

Client:
src/app/reviews/reviewClient.jsx
'use client'
import { useState } from "react"
import DislikeServer from "./Dislike"

export default function MyReview() {
    //declare state
    const [like, setLike] = useState(0)

    const onLike = () => {
        setLike(like + 1)
    }

    return <div>
        <h3>Like {like}</h3>
        <button onClick={onLike}>Like</button>
        {/* Use server component */}
        <DislikeServer/>
    </div>

In the code, DislikeServer component runs in the client only....

What if client uses server component but at the same time, i dont want to loose server rendering feature?

Solution:

 Pass Server component as prop to Child Component..

<Client>
    <Server/>
</Client>

src/app/client/myserver.jsx
export default function MyServer(){
    return <div>
        <h1>Server Component</h1>
    </div>
}
src/app/client/myclient.jsx
'use client'

// import MyServer from "./myserver"

export default function MyClient(props){
    return <div>
        <h1>Client component</h1>
        {/* <MyServer></MyServer> */}
        {props.children}
    </div>
}

src/app/client/page.js
import MyClient from "./myclient";
import MyServer from "./myserver";

export default function ClientPage() {
    return <>
        <h1>Client Page</h1>
        <MyClient>
            {/* sending server as prop  */}
            <MyServer/>
        </MyClient>
    </>
}
....................................................................................

3.Client Uses another client Component...

Client uses another client.

src/app/myreviews/page.js
import MyReview from "./MyReview";

export default function Likes(){
    return <div>
        MyReview Page
        <MyReview></MyReview>
    </div>
}

Client:

src/app/myreviews/MyReview.jsx

'use client'

import Like from "./like"

export default function MyReview() {
        return <>
        <Like></Like>
    </>
}
src/app/myreviews/like.jsx
// 'use client'
import { useState } from "react"

export default function Like() {
    //declare state
    const [like, setLike] = useState(0)

    const onLike = () => {
        setLike(like + 1)
    }

    return <div>
        <h3>Like {like}</h3>
        <button onClick={onLike}>Like</button>
    </div>
}

Note:
 if client component uses another client component, that another client component no need to use "use client" directive.
This would be very use full when we use third party ui components into next js...
primiarly used for migration...

Creating a new Next.js app in G:\IBM\2024\March\Nextjs\advanced-routing.


		...............Linking and Navigation.......


There are four ways to navigate between routes in Next.js

1.Using <Link> Component
2.Using useRouter Hook
3.redirect function
4.Using native History api

Reddirection/navigation can happen in two places

1.Server side redirection/navigation
   Redirection is controlled by server
2.Client side redirection/navigation
   Redirection is controlled by browser


Server side Navigation:
1.redirect function
2.permantRedirect function
3.routeConfig file
4.API redirections - NextResponse.redirect

Client Side Navigation:

1.Link Component
2.useRouter Hook
3.Native History API


Link Component:
 Link is in built Component from next, like Link Next many in built components

Built in Components:

1.Link
2.Image
3.Script
4.Font

Link:

1.Link is a built in component that extends the HTML <a> tag.
2.It enables client side navigation.
3.It enables prefetching feature...
4.It is part of "next/link" package

Link Props:

1.href - url
2.replace
3.scroll
4.prefetch

Syntax:
 href value can be string or object.

 <Link href="/about">About</Link>
 <Link href={{pathname:'/customer',query:{name:'ibm'}}}>About</Link>

Master Navigation:

 Navigation for full app.
 if you want to share nav bar , site footer, across the application, you have to write nav bar inside root layout.

src/app/layout.js
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
import Link from "next/link";
// import "./globals.css";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <div id="header">
          <h1>My Commerce</h1>
          <hr />
          <nav>
            <Link href={{ pathname: '/about' }}>About</Link> |
            <Link href={{ pathname: '/services' }}>Services</Link> |
            <Link href={{ pathname: '/' }}>Home</Link> |
          </nav>
        </div>
        {children}

        <hr />
        <div>
          <p>footer</p>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
src/app/about/page.js


export default function AboutPage() {
    return <div>
        <h1>About Page</h1>
    </div>
}
src/app/services/page.js
export default function Services() {
    return <div>
        <h1>Service Page</h1>
    </div>
}
src/app/page.js


export default function HomePage() {
  return <div>
    <h1>Home Page</h1>
  </div>
}
.....................................................................................
				Active Links
.....................................................................................
How to enable active link feature?

You can use hook "usePathname()" to determine if a  link is active..
For example to add a class to the active link, you can check the current pathname matches the href of the link...

Syntax
import {usePathname} from 'next/navigation'

const pathname = usePathname()

<Link className={`link ${pathname==='/' ? 'active': ''}`} href="/">Home</Link>


if you add "usePathname", then that component must be client component..

Error: usePathname only works in Client Components. Add the "use client" directive at the top of the file to use it. Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/react-client-hook-in-server-component


if you add inside root layout, you will get error, if you want active link feature, you want to include into server component(root layout/layout), you have to create separate link client component and include it.

src/app/components/link.css
.active {
    color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
}

src/app/components/links.jsx
'use client'
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
import Link from "next/link";
import './link.css'

export function Links() {
    const pathname = usePathname()
    return <nav>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/' ? 'active' : ''}`} href={{ pathname: '/' }}>Home</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
                <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/about' ? 'active' : ''}`} href={{ pathname: '/about' }}>About</Link>
            </li>
            <li>
                <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/services' ? 'active' : ''}`} href={{ pathname: '/services' }}>Services</Link>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav >
}
src/app/layout.js
import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
// import Link from "next/link";
import { Links } from "./components/links";
// import "./globals.css";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>
        <div id="header">
          <h1>My Commerce</h1>
          <hr />
          <Links />
        </div>
        {children}

        <hr />
        <div>
          <p>Footer</p>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
.....................................................................................
				useRouter Hook
.....................................................................................

userRouter hook allows you programmatically change route from client components.

src/app/components/DashboardNavigator.jsx

'use client'
import { useRouter } from "next/navigation"

export function DashBoardNavigator() {
    const router = useRouter()
    return <>
        <button onClick={() => {
            router.push('/dashboard')
        }}>Dashboard</button>
    </>
}

src/app/page.js
import { DashBoardNavigator } from "./components/DashboardNavigator";


export default function HomePage() {
  return <div>
    <h1>Home Page</h1>
    <DashBoardNavigator/>
  </div>
}

src/app/components/links.jsx
'use client'
import { usePathname } from "next/navigation";
import Link from "next/link";
import './link.css'

export function Links() {
    const pathname = usePathname()
    return <nav>
        <ul>
           <li>
                <Link className={`link ${pathname === '/dashboard' ? 'active' : ''}`} href={{ pathname: '/dashboard' }}>Dashboard</Link>
            </li>
        </ul>
    </nav >
}
...................................................................................
			  Server side Navigation
...................................................................................

1.redirect api 
  The redirect function is the function allows you to redirect the user to another URL

Purpose:
 redirect after form submit
 redirect after a mutation or event...
Where:
  Server components,Server Actions, Route Handlers

Status code and redirect function:

307- Temp
303 - Server actions

Syntax:
export default function update(){
  //update logic
  redirect('success') //navigate to success page
}
Implementation will see later when we discuss server actions and api handlers...

2.permanentRedirect
  It is similar to redirect, but the status code would be 308

3.redirects in next.config.js
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    //redirct configuration
    async redirects() {
        return [
            {
                source: '/foo',
                destination: '/about',
                permanent: true
            }
        ]
    }
};

export default nextConfig;

4.NextResponse.redirect
   Inside Middleware
....................................................................................
			 Common concepts in navigation
...................................................................................

1.Prefetching:
.............

 pre-means in advance or ahead of time
 fetching - means getting or loading

Prefetching is way to preload a route in the background before the user visits it.

Lets assume i have menus like
 about,products,services,customers

if i click any menu, that time only page is fetched from the server (Server receives request--render page--return page to browser)

When you enable prefetch feature, the page is requested before user clicks the link for that particular page. - It is ready already..

How to enable prefetch feature?

<Link> Component:
   Routes are by default automatically prefetched as they become visible in the user's(browser's) view port. 
   Prefetching happens when the page first loads or when it comes into view through scrolling..
   Prefetching feature is not enabled in dev mode, only production mode.

Link 's Prefetch behaviour can be disabled by using property called prefetch=false

   <Link href="/dashboard" prefetch={false}>
      Dashboard
    </Link>

prefetch has three values:

1.null /default
2.true
3.false

There are two types of route:

1.static route
    prefetch is true by default in static route
2.dynamic route
    prefetch is default to automatic/null

.....................................................................................
			Soft Navigation
.....................................................................................

Browsers perfom a hard navigation when navigating between pages.
The Next.js app router enables "soft navigation" between pages, ensuring only the route segments that have changed are re-rendered(partial rendering).
Soft Navigation helps or enables "react state" to be preserved during navigation.

What is dynamic route?
  When you don't know the exact segment names ahead of time and want to create routes from dynamic data, you can use Dynamic Segments that are filled in at request time or prerendered at build time.

How to represent dynamic path?

  /users - static route
  /users/1 -dynamic route
  /users/100

How to create dynamic route?

Convention:
   A dynamic segment can be created by wrapping a folder's name in square brackets.
  [folderName]
   eg:
     [id] or [city] or [slug]

Use Case:
 Building Master detail page..

Using mock data
Using api call

Master Page with Mock Data:
...........................

src/app/todos/page.js
import { TODOS } from "./mock-data/todos"

export default function TodosMasterPage() {
    return <>
        <h1>Todos Master</h1>
        <ul>
            {
                TODOS.map(todo => {
                    return <li>
                        <span>{todo.title}</span>
                    </li>
                })
            }
        </ul>
    </>
}
Note: refer code base for mock data.

When i click the particular todo , i have to navigate to detail page.

Details Page:

src/app/todos/[id]/page.js


export default function TodosDetailPage(){
    return <>
        <h1>Todos detail page</h1>
    </>
}

Linking Master Page with Detail Page:

src/app/todos/page.js

import Link from "next/link"
import { TODOS } from "./mock-data/todos"

export default function TodosMasterPage() {
    return <>
        <h1>Todos Master</h1>
        <ul>
            {
                TODOS.map(todo => {
                    return <li>
                        <Link href={`/todos/${todo.id}`}>{todo.title}</Link>
                    </li>
                })
            }
        </ul>
    </>
}

How to read path Parameters?

Rout Parameters are available inside detail page via props.

props.params => {}

src/app/components/todos/[id]/page.js

// export default function TodosDetailPage(props) {
//     console.log(props)
//     return <>
//         <h1>Todos detail page</h1>
//         <h2>{props.params.id} details </h2>
//     </>
// }

export default function TodosDetailPage({params:{id}}) {
    //console.log(props)
    return <>
        <h1>Todos detail page</h1>
        <h2>{id} details </h2>
    </>
}
...................................................................................
		 Master details page Prepartion using API Calls
....................................................................................

In next js , api calls are made using "fetch" api by default.
fetch is promse powered, when ever or where ever you call fetch api, you can use async .. await keywords

server components functions, apis are marked as async keyword..

src/app/photos/page.js
import Link from "next/link"

//fetch photos
export async function fetchPhotos() {
    const response = await fetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos')
    const photos = await response.json()
    //here we return Promise of Photos
    return photos
}

export default  async function PhotosMasterPage() {
    const photos = await fetchPhotos()
    return <>
        <h1>Photos Master</h1>
        <ul>
            {
                photos.map(photo => {
                    return <li>
                        <Link href={`/photos/${photo.id}`}>{photo.title}</Link>
                    </li>
                })
            }
        </ul>
    </>
}

src/app/photos/[id]/page.js
import Image from "next/image"

export async function fetchPhotoById(id) {
    const response = await fetch(`https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/photos/${id}`)
    const photo = await response.json()
    //here we return Promise of Photos
    return photo
}
export default async function PhotosDetailPage({ params: { id } }) {
    const photo = await fetchPhotoById(Number(id))
    return <>
        <h1>Photos  detail page</h1>
        <h2>Id {photo.id} </h2>
        <h2>Album Id {photo.albumId} </h2>
        <p>Title {photo.title}</p>
        <a href={`${photo.url}`}>{photo.url}</a>
        <Image
            src={`${photo.thumbnailUrl}`}
            width={500}
            height={500}
            alt="Picture of the Picture"
        /> 
    </>
}		

in order to display remote images, we need to  configure, next.config.mjs file

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
    images: {
        remotePatterns: [
            {
                protocol: 'https',
                hostname: 'via.placeholder.com',
                port: '',
                pathname: '/150/**',
            },
        ],
    },

};

export default nextConfig;
....................................................................................
			Advanced Routing-Dynamic routes
			 "Catch-All Segment Routing"
...................................................................................

Dynamic segments can be extended to catch all subsequent by adding [...slug]

Without CatchAll:
................

/shop/a 
/shop/b
/shop/c

shop
  |
  [a]
    |
    page.js
  |
  [b]
   |
    page.js
  [c]
   |
    page.js
 page.js

what if dynamic routes are not predefined in advance.

With Catch All:
................

 shop
  |
  page.js
  |
  [...slug]
    |
    page.js

/shop/tops
/shop/tops/tshirt
/shop/dress/men/shirt

How to capture parameter?
 {
   slug:['tops','tshirt','men','shirt']
 }


src/app/shop/page.js
export default function ShopPage() {
    return <>
        <h1>Shop Page</h1>
    </>
}

src/app/shop/[...slug]/page.js
export default function ShopDetailsPage({ params }) {
    return <>
        <h1>Shop Details Page</h1>
        <h2>{JSON.stringify(params)}</h2>
    </>
}
.....................................................................................
			Advanced Routing-Dynamic Routes
		       "Optional Catch-All Segment Routing"
		
In the catch-All segement routing, the root folder has page.js, without that page.js what will happen>

src/app/shop/[...slug]/page.js

http://localhost:3000/shop
  ->It will throw page not found.

There would be use case , i dont want page.js inside /shop.

Thats where Optional CatchAll segment Routing comes picture..

src/app/shop/[[...slug]]
             |
     page.js

Eg:

src/app/shop/[[...slug]]/page.js
export default function ShopDetailsPage({ params }) {
    return <>
        <h1>Shop Details Page</h1>
        <h2>{JSON.stringify(params)}</h2>
    </>
}

Conclusion in dynamic routing:

 src/app/user/[id]- static dynamic routing
 src/app/shop/tops - dynamic catch all routing
 src/shop/
       page.js
 src/shop/[...slug]/page.js
 src/app/shop/[[...slug]/page.js -dynamic optional catch all routing
.....................................................................................
			Advanced Routing- Parallel Routes
.....................................................................................
What is Parallel route?
  Generally inside a layout, we render only one page by default.

What if i want to render "Multiple Pages" inside single layout simultaneously or conditionally.
 
"Parallel Routing allows you to simultaneously or conditionally render one or more pages in the same layout.
 For highly sections of an app, such as dashbords,and feeds on sites, Parallel Routing can be used to implement complex routing patterns"

Component View: Single Page witin layout.

<Layout>
   <Page/>
</Layout>

Component View: Mutliple Pages within layout

<Layout>
   <Page1/>
   <Page2>
</Layout>

Component View: Conditional Rendering

<Layout>
   {condition ? <ThisPage/> : <ThatPage/>
</Layout>

src/app/game/@team/page.js

export default function TeamPage(){
    return <div>
        <h1>Team Page</h1>
    </div>
}

src/app/game/@anaylitics/page.js
export default function AnalyticsPage(){
    return <div>
        <h1>Analytics Page</h1>
    </div>
}

Now if you test 
http://localhost:3000/game/team
   The output would be pagenot found, the reason is you cant access team page publicily, team page is part of something, that means , you must inject into game layout.
 How to inject into game layout...
   via props


Insert team and anayltics page content into game layout.

src/app/game/layout.js
export default function GameLayout(props) {
    return <div id="gameslayout">
        {/* Game Page content */}
         {props.children}
         {/* Team Page */}
         {props.team}
         {/* Analytics Page */}
         {props.anaylitics}
    </div>
}

As of now we have seen how to render multiple pages into a layout.

Now we are going to discuss how to render page or pages into a layout based on condition.

Slot:
 Portion of UI.
 Slots are defined using named slots
 Slots are defined with @folder convention
 For eg @team,@player
 Slotss are passed as props to the shared parent layout.

We render a slot based UI based on certain conditions,such as checkbox, and options,authentication states...

Synax:

@AdminPanel
@UserPanel

src/app/panel/page.js
export default function PanelPage() {
    return <>
        <h1>Panel Page</h1>
    </>
}
src/app/panel/@AdminPanel/page.js
export default function AdminPanel(){
    return <>
      <h1>Admin Panel Page</h1>
    </>
}
src/app/panel/@UserPanel/page.js
export default function UserPanel(){
    return <>
      <h1>User Panel Page</h1>
    </>
}
src/app/panel/layout.js
export default function PanelLayout(props) {
    const isAdmin = true

    return <div id="panelLayout">
        {/* Panel Page */}
        {props.children}
        {/* Conditional Rendering */}
        {isAdmin ? props.AdminPanel : props.UserPanel}
    </div>
}

			ParrelRouting -UnMatched Routing
.....................................................................................

default.js

 You can define default.js file to render as a fallback for unmatched slots during inital load or full page reload.

src/app/panel/@UserPanel/default.js
export default function UserFallback(){
    return <h1>Fallback UI</h1>
}

		      Advanced Routing - Route Groups
......................................................................................
What is Route Group?

In the app directory, nested folders are mapped to URL Paths. How ever, you can mark a folder as a Route Group to prevent the folder being inlcuded in the Route' URL Path..

src/app/dashboard/page.js   ==> /dashboard

You can mark a folder as a "Route Group" to prevent the folder being included in the rout's URL Path.

Which is some times called as hidden dirs...

Why Route Groups:

 =>Organize your route segments and project files into logical groups without affecting the URL path Structure.

=> Organizing routes into groups eg Site Section, intent, or team.

=> Enabling nested layout in the same route segment level.
    You can multiple root layouts in different segements


Convention:
  A Route group can be created by wrapping a folder's name in ()

eg:

 (folderName)

G:\IBM\2024\March\Nextjs>npx create-next-app@latest

Creating a new Next.js app in G:\IBM\2024\March\Nextjs\route-groups.

Using npm.

src/app/(auth)/signin/page.js
export default function SignInPage(){
    return <>
        <h1>Sigin Page</h1>
    </>
}

src/app/(auth)/login/page.js
export default function loginPage(){
    return <>
        <h1>Login Page</h1>
    </>

................................................................................
if you need multiple root layouts,for eg i am building ecommerce app, where auth is separate domain, product separate domain...

If you need different layout inside each domain, we have to remove root layout file.

inside domain layout, you have to return html.


Steps:

1.just remove src/app/layout.js or rename.
2.add src/app/(auth)layout.js
// export default function AuthLayout({children}){
//     return <div id="authlayout">
//            {children}
//     </div>
// }

import { Inter } from "next/font/google";
// import "./globals.css";

const inter = Inter({ subsets: ["latin"] });

export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={inter.className}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
